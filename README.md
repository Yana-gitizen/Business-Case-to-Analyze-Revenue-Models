Choosing whether a revenue model is "good to go" (approved) or "to be rejected" through a business case requires a structured evaluation of its financial, operational, and market viability. A robust business case should demonstrate that the model aligns with customer buying behavior, generates consistent, scalable, and profitable income, and can be executed within defined constraints. 
Here is how I evaluate and decide on a revenue model: 
1. Key "Good to Go" Indicators 
A revenue model is likely "good to go" if it exhibits:

• Customer Alignment
• High Revenue Predictability 
• Healthy Unit Economics
• Scalability: Revenue grows as the customer base increases without requiring a proportional increase in operational costs. 
• Clear Differentiation: The model provides a competitive advantage, such as a unique pricing structure that competitors cannot easily copy. 
• Positive Cash Flow: Projections show that the model will cover all fixed and variable costs comfortably, allowing for profitability.

2. Red Flags for Rejection 
A revenue model should likely be rejected or heavily revised if the business case shows: 

• No Market Need or Demand
• Poor Unit Economics
• Inconsistent Income
• High Value Chain Resistance
• Low Barriers to Entry 
• Unrealistic Assumptions
3. Evaluation Framework (The "Business Case" Test) 
| Component  | Good to Go Signal | Rejection Signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customer Behavior | Fits how they buy | Mismatched to customer needs |
| Revenue Stream | Recurring/Predictable | Unpredictable/Low-margin |
| Costs | Low CAC, High LTV | High acquisition costs/high churn |
| Market | Unique/Hard to mimic | Saturated/Easy to mimic |
| Operations | Scalable/Feasible | Inefficient/Too complex |
| Validation | Based on pilot data | Based on assumptions |

If the business case reveals that the model is too risky, cannot be executed, or does not provide a path to profitability, the decision should be to reject or pivot to a different model. 


• Conduct a Sensitivity Analysis: Test the model's success against best-case, worst-case, and most-likely scenarios. If a 10% increase in costs destroys profitability, it is too risky. 
• Validate Customer Willingness to Pay: Use pilot data, surveys, or interviews to confirm that the target customer will actually pay the projected price. 
• Verify Operational Feasibility: Ensure the company has the resources, technology, and team to deliver the value and execute the model. 
• Check Legal and Compliance: Ensure the revenue model complies with data protection, taxation, and other regulations.
